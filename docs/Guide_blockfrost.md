# Guide: Installing OPN Using the *Blockfrost* API for Syncing

By default, OPN (Open Prism Node) synchronizes data using *dbsync* as its backend database. However, if *dbsync* is not
available or not preferred, OPN can alternatively be synced using the [*Blockfrost* API](https://docs.blockfrost.io/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This setup only applies to data synchronization. The creation and modification of DIDs still requires a
> Cardano Wallet. For instructions on how to set up the Cardano Wallet, refer to
> the [official documentation](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-wallet).

---

## Prerequisites

- SSH or terminal access to the server. The recommended environment is **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**. Windows Subsystem for
  Linux (WSL) may also work but has not been tested.
- A Blockfrost API key, available for free at [blockfrost.io](https://blockfrost.io/).
  > Note: The free tier allows up to **50,000 requests per day**. The initial sync may take approximately 36 hours (~3
  days), but subsequent daily usage will remain well within this limit.

## Installation

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and paste the following contents:

```yaml
version: '3.9'
services:
  openprismnode:
    image: ghcr.io/bsandmann/openprismnode:latest
    container_name: openprismnode
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - prismdb
      - seq
    environment:
      - AppSettings__AdminAuthorizationKey=pwAdmin!
      - AppSettings__UserAuthorizationKey=pwUser!
      - AppSettings__PrismLedger__Name=preprod
      - AppSettings__PrismLedger__PrismPostgresConnectionString=Host=prismdb;Database=prismdatabase;Username=postgres;Password=postgres
      - AppSettings__CardanoWalletApiEndpoint=
      - AppSettings__CardanoWalletApiEndpointPort=
      - AppSettings__GrpcPort=50053
      - AppSettings__ApiHttpsPort=5001
      - AppSettings__SyncDataSource__Provider=Blockfrost
      - AppSettings__Blockfrost__BaseUrl=https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0
      - AppSettings__Blockfrost__ApiKey=preprod123....
      - Seq__ServerUrl=http://seq:5341

    # Publish ports for external access if needed
    ports:
      - "5001:5001"
      - "50053:50053"
    networks:
      - prismnet

  prismdb:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: prismdb
  restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
      - POSTGRES_DB=prismdatabase
    expose:
      - "5432"
    volumes:
      - prismdb_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    networks:
      - prismnet

    seq:
      image: datalust/seq:latest
      container_name: seq
  restart: always
    environment:
      - ACCEPT_EULA=Y
    ports:
      - "5341:5341"
    volumes:
      - seq_data:/data
    networks:
      - prismnet

volumes:
  prismdb_data:
  seq_data:

networks:
  prismnet:
    driver: bridge
```

2. Replace the placeholder API key with your actual Blockfrost API key.

3. Update the admin and user passwords as needed.
   > üîê If the OPN instance is exposed to the internet, it is **strongly recommended** to change the admin password to
   prevent unauthorized access and potential data loss.

4. Navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and start the services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Syncing

The synchronization process starts automatically. To monitor progress:

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001` (or the appropriate IP address). This will open the OPN user
  interface. ![image](./images/scr6.png) You can see the connected network as well the different endpoints. Click on
  *Swagger / OpenAPI Documentation* to get the API endpoints for reference.
- Log in using the **admin password**
- From the admin interface, you can monitor and control the sync process via UI or API. ![image](./images/scr5.png)
  You can see the current sync state and the number of blocks that are already synced. You can stop and start the sync
  process and also rollback to a previous block or epoch.

## Wallet Creation

To create a wallet:

1. Log in using the **user password**
   This password can be shared publicly to allow users to create their own wallets on the OPN.

2. After logging in, the user can immediately generate a new wallet. Syncing will begin automatically (note: this
   requires that the Cardano Wallet is running and the OPN is synced). ![image](./images/scr3.png)

3. The user should:
- Record the **mnemonic** and **wallet ID**
- Use the **wallet ID** for future logins instead of the shared user password
![image](./images/scr2.png)

4. Once syncing completes, the wallet interface will show the **funding address** and **current balance**. State of a un-synced wallet: ![iamge](./images/scr1.png) State of a synced wallet: ![image](./images/scr7.png)

5. The wallet ID can now be used to:
- Create new DIDs
- Modify existing DIDs (update/deactivate)
  Simple use the walletId and use it as a request parameter in the API call against the Registrar API.
