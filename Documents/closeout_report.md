## Challenge KPIs
- First fully open-source PRISM node; enables anyone to run their own instance or use our free hosted service. Indepent from IOG code.
- Released v1.0.0 (Apache-2.0) and two public nodes (Mainnet & Pre-Prod)

## Project KPIs
- Successfully completed all defined project requirements and open-sourced under Apache 2.0
- Provided comprehensive documentation and a step-by-step guide for users unfamiliar with the technology.
- Collaborated with the Atala/Identus team.

## Key Achievements (particularly around collaboration and engagement)
- Delivered presentations and engaged actively with the broader Identus community.
- Engaged as a maintainer of the Hyperleger Identus project with the IOG team
- The software is already used internally for other projects as well as for production environments for other teams

## Key Learnings
- Open standards proved essential. Rather than developing proprietary solutions, we integrated open standards like the DID Resolution spec, DID Registrar Spec for the public APIs for the project
- Writing, Testing an retesting of software which reads data from chain a time consuming process. A lot of instrastructure and patience is required with the resync the node for the 100th time
- Beiing compatible with other software which is also constantly evolving is sometimes a bit frustrating

## Next Steps

We'll continue to support the node and the hosted instances. This includes bugfixes and updates for the foreseable future

## Final Thoughts

We hope that Lace will soon support PRISM DIDs, providing projects like ours with the audience and momentum necessary for widespread adoption. SSI on Cardano, despite the ongoing development by IOG and the community has still a long way to go.
